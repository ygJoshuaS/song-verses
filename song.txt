Verse 1
So many faces, so many races
Different voices, different choices
And some are mad, while others laugh
Some live alone with no better half
Others grieve, while others curse
And others mourn behind a big black hearse
And some are pure, and some half-bred
And some are sober, and some are wasted
Some are rich because of fate
And some are poor with no food on their plate
Some stand out, while others blend
And some are fat and stout, while some are thin
And some are friends and some are foes
Some have some, while some have most
Yeah
Verse 2
'Cause every color every hue 
is represented by me and you
take a slide in the slope 
take a look in the kaleidoscope 
spinnin' round, make it twirl in this kaleidoscope world 
Verse 3
Some are great and some are few
Others lie, while some tell the truth
And some say poems and some do sing
Another sing through their guitar strings
Some know it all, while some act dumb
Let the bass line strum to the bang of the drum
Some can swim, while some will sink
And some will find their minds and think
Others walk, while others run
You can't talk peace and have a gun
Some are hurt and start to cry
Don't ask me how don't ask me why
And some are friends and some are foes
Some have some while some have most
Yeah
